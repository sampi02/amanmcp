## Quick Start

**Prerequisite:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed (`brew install ollama`)

```bash
# Install
brew tap Aman-CERP/tap && brew install amanmcp

# Initialize (auto-starts Ollama, pulls model, indexes)
cd your-project && amanmcp init

# Restart Claude Code. Done.
```

**Ask Claude:** "Search my codebase for authentication"
