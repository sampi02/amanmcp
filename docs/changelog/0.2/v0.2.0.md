# v0.2.0 - 2026-01-10

## AI-Native PM System Complete

Major milestone: Full AI-native project management system with memory awareness.

This release represents a significant evolution of AmanMCP, adding comprehensive project
management capabilities designed specifically for AI-assisted development workflows.

---

## Added

- AI-Native PM system v2.0 with memory awareness
  - Sprint system with capacity planning (78h/sprint)
  - Numeric sprint IDs (1, 2, 3... instead of date-based)
  - Memory section in index.yaml for session continuity
- 7 PM skills:
  - `/aman-pm` - Sprint status, backlog management, sync
  - `/session-start` - Memory-aware session initialization
  - `/session-end` - Learning capture and session handoff
  - `/backlog-groom` - Backlog analysis with impact analysis
  - `/sprint-report` - Sprint metrics and retrospective
  - `/release` - Version management and changelog automation
  - `/rearchitect` - AI-driven architecture change processing
- Knowledge persistence system:
  - `learnings.md` - Technical discoveries that persist
  - `decisions.md` - Architecture decisions with rationale
  - `velocity.json` - Historical velocity tracking
  - `architecture-triggers.yaml` - Impact analysis triggers
- Session handoff system with accountability documents
- Development plan sequencing system (`--plan`, `--resequence`)
- Architecture impact analysis (`--impact` flag)
- 128 backlog items migrated with full metadata

## Changed

- Reorganized `.aman-pm/` directory structure
  - `backlog/` with individual item files (not monolithic YAML)
  - `knowledge/` for persistent memory
  - `sessions/` for handoff documents
  - `sprints/` for sprint management
- Skill registry updated to v3.3.0
- Session skills now memory-aware (surface learnings at start, capture at end)

## Fixed

- Tracking file synchronization issues resolved
- Sprint items.yaml kept in sync with actual backlog state

## Documentation

- Comprehensive AI-Native PM Guide (708 lines)
- AI-Native PM Quick Start guide
- Rearchitecture system documentation
- Session handoff templates

## Upgrade Notes

This version introduces the `.aman-pm/` directory structure. If upgrading from 0.1.x:

1. The PM system is optional - core search functionality unchanged
2. Run `/session-start` to initialize the PM system
3. See `.aman-pm/guides/ai-native-pm-guide.md` for full documentation

## Migration

No breaking changes to the core AmanMCP search functionality. The PM system is
an additive feature layer for AI-assisted development workflows.
