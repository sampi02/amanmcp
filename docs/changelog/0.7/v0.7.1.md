# v0.7.1

**Released:** 2026-01-14

## Fixed

- BUG-062: Fix `matchDirPattern` to handle `dir/**` patterns from config (`.amanmcp.yaml`)
  - Config exclusions like `.aman-pm/**` now work correctly
  - Follows Unix Philosophy: no hardcoded values, respect user config

## Details

The pattern matching function `matchDirPattern` in the scanner only handled:
- `**/dir/**` patterns (with `**/` prefix)
- Exact matches

It did NOT handle `dir/**` patterns (without leading `**/`) which is the format users put in `.amanmcp.yaml`.

This fix adds proper handling for `dir/**` patterns, ensuring config-based exclusions work as intended.

### Files Changed

- `internal/scanner/scanner.go` - Added `dir/**` pattern support
- `internal/scanner/scanner_test.go` - Added `TestMatchDirPattern_DirGlob` (11 test cases)
- Added Unix Philosophy principles section
