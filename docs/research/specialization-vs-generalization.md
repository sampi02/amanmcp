## Executive Summary

After a thorough audit of the AmanMCP codebase, we identified an uncomfortable truth: **we had been building a Go-specific search tool optimized for this exact codebase, not a generalizable code search solution.**

The evidence was pervasive: hardcoded Go syntax patterns, path conventions specific to Go projects, validation queries referencing this project's exact file paths, and domain-specific boosting for "Search" and "Index" nouns—we had systematically "taught to the test" rather than solving the underlying problem.

This analysis documents the evidence, explains why it happened, and shows how we corrected it.

---

## Part 1: The Evidence

### 1.1 Go-Specific Syntax Patterns (decomposer.go)

The query decomposer is hardcoded for Go syntax:

```go
// Lines 187-207: All patterns are Go-specific
{Query: ") " + capitalNoun + "(", Weight: 1.5, Hint: "code"},  // Go method receiver
{Query: capitalNoun + "(ctx", Weight: 1.4, Hint: "code"},      // Go context param
{Query: "func " + capitalNoun, Weight: 1.2, Hint: "code"},     // Go func keyword
{Query: "func (" + lowerNoun, Weight: 1.1, Hint: "code"},      // Go receiver syntax
```

**What other languages use:**

| Language | Function Definition Syntax |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Python | `def search(self, ...)` |
| JavaScript | `search(...) { }` or `search = () => {}` |
| TypeScript | `search(query: string): Result[]` |
| Java | `public void search(...)` |
| Rust | `fn search(&self, ...)` or `pub fn search(...)` |
| C# | `public void Search(...)` |
| Ruby | `def search(...)` |

**The patterns we generate would find NOTHING in these languages.**

### 1.2 Hardcoded Domain Knowledge (decomposer.go:211-222)

We literally hardcoded knowledge about THIS codebase:

```go
switch strings.ToLower(noun) {
case "search":
    subQueries = append(subQueries,
        SubQuery{Query: "engine.go Search", Weight: 1.1, Hint: "code"},
        SubQuery{Query: "Engine Search", Weight: 1.0, Hint: "code"},
    )
case "index":
    subQueries = append(subQueries,
        SubQuery{Query: "Coordinator", Weight: 1.0, Hint: "code"},
        SubQuery{Query: "index/", Weight: 0.9, Hint: "code"},
    )
}
```

This is not search engineering. This is memorizing the answers to the test.

### 1.3 Go Project Structure Assumptions (options.go:296-305)

The path boosting assumes Go project conventions:

```go
// IsImplementationPath checks if a path is implementation code (internal/).
func IsImplementationPath(filePath string) bool {
    return strings.HasPrefix(filePath, "internal/") ||
        strings.Contains(filePath, "/internal/")
}

// IsWrapperPath checks if a path is CLI wrapper code (cmd/).
func IsWrapperPath(filePath string) bool {
    return strings.HasPrefix(filePath, "cmd/") ||
        strings.Contains(filePath, "/cmd/")
}
```

**What other ecosystems use:**

| Ecosystem | Implementation Path | Entry Point Path |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Go | `internal/` | `cmd/` |
| Python | `src/`, `lib/`, `package_name/` | `scripts/`, `bin/` |
| JavaScript | `src/`, `lib/` | `bin/`, `cli/` |
| Java/Maven | `src/main/java/` | (same) |
| Rust | `src/` | `src/bin/` |
| Ruby | `lib/` | `bin/`, `exe/` |

A Python project with `src/search/engine.py` would get NO boost.
A Java project with `src/main/java/com/example/Search.java` would get NO boost.

### 1.4 Test File Detection (options.go:218-243)

The test detection covers Go, JavaScript, and Python—three languages:

```go
if strings.HasSuffix(filePath, "_test.go") { return true }           // Go
if strings.Contains(filePath, ".test.") ||
   strings.Contains(filePath, ".spec.") { return true }               // JS/TS
if strings.HasPrefix(fileName, "test_") &&
   strings.HasSuffix(fileName, ".py") { return true }                 // Python
```

**Missing coverage:**

| Language | Test Convention | Detected? |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| C# | `*Tests.cs`, `*Spec.cs` | NO |
| Java | `*Test.java` (JUnit), `*IT.java` | NO |
| Rust | `tests/`, `#[cfg(test)]` | NO |
| Ruby | `*_spec.rb`, `spec/` | NO |
| Kotlin | `*Test.kt` | NO |
| PHP | `*Test.php` (PHPUnit) | NO |
| Swift | `*Tests.swift` | NO |

### 1.5 Validation Queries Reference This Codebase (spec.md)

The validation specification expects EXACT paths from THIS project:

```markdown
| 7 | Search function | search_code | internal/search/engine.go | FAIL |
| 8 | Index function | search_code | internal/index/ | FAIL |
| 11 | OllamaEmbedder | search_code | internal/embed/ollama.go | PASS |
```

These are not abstract quality metrics. They are regression tests for THIS codebase.

### 1.6 File Extension Assumptions (decomposer.go:74, :258)

```go
// Assumes .go files are the target
filePathPattern: regexp.MustCompile(`...\.go|ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|md|json|yaml|yml)$`)

// Generates .go file hints
subQueries = append(subQueries, SubQuery{
    Query:  strings.ToLower(word) + ".go",  // Hardcoded .go
    Weight: 1.1,
    Hint:   "code",
})
```

## Part 2: Why This Happened

### 2.1 The TDD Trap

We followed TDD religiously. But our tests were:
- Validation queries about THIS codebase
- Expectations of specific file paths in THIS project
- Success metrics tied to THIS project's structure

TDD doesn't prevent overfitting—it can CAUSE it when the tests themselves are too narrow.

### 2.2 Dogfooding Bias

Dogfooding is valuable, but it creates a selection bias:
- We only see bugs in OUR usage patterns
- We only measure success against OUR queries
- We only optimize for OUR project structure

A team using AmanMCP on a Python monorepo would have completely different failures.

### 2.3 Incremental Optimization

Each bug fix optimized for the specific failure:
- BUG-066: Wrapper outranks implementation → Add `internal/` boost (Go-specific)
- FEAT-QI4: Test files outrank implementation → Add `_test.go` penalty (Go-specific)
- FEAT-QI3: "Search function" fails → Add Go method patterns (Go-specific)

We never asked: "Will this work for a Java project?"

### 2.4 The Pressure to Ship

Sprint goals, validation targets, "green CI"—these create pressure to fix the immediate problem. Research and generalization feel like scope creep when you're trying to hit 100% Tier 1.

---

## Part 3: The Cost of Specialization

### 3.1 Limited Market

AmanMCP, as currently implemented, is primarily useful for:
- Go projects
- With `internal/` and `cmd/` conventions
- Where "function" means Go methods

This excludes:
- Python/JavaScript/Java/Rust/Ruby ecosystems
- Non-conventional Go projects
- Polyglot monorepos (the most complex use case)

### 3.2 Technical Debt

Every hardcoded pattern is debt:
- 7 Go-specific patterns in decomposer
- 2 hardcoded domain terms ("search", "index")
- 2 Go path conventions (`internal/`, `cmd/`)
- 3 language test file patterns (partial coverage)

Future language support requires:
- Rewriting decomposer for each language
- Adding path conventions for each ecosystem
- Extending test file patterns
- New validation suites per language

### 3.3 False Confidence

We achieved 67% Tier 1 validation. But that 67% is:
- On our own project
- Using our own conventions
- With patterns tuned to our queries

On a Python Django project, we might be at 10%.

## Part 4: What Generalization Would Look Like

### 4.1 Language-Aware Pattern Engine

Instead of hardcoded patterns, a configurable engine:

```yaml
# .amanmcp.yaml (project config)
language_patterns:
  go:
    function_patterns:
      - pattern: ") {Name}("
        weight: 1.5
        description: "Go method receiver"
      - pattern: "func {Name}"
        weight: 1.2
        description: "Go function"
    implementation_paths: ["internal/"]
    wrapper_paths: ["cmd/"]
    test_patterns: ["_test.go"]

  python:
    function_patterns:
      - pattern: "def {name}"
        weight: 1.3
        description: "Python function"
      - pattern: "def {name}(self"
        weight: 1.5
        description: "Python method"
    implementation_paths: ["src/", "lib/"]
    wrapper_paths: ["scripts/", "bin/"]
    test_patterns: ["test_*.py", "*_test.py"]
```

### 4.2 Automatic Language Detection

```go
// Detect project languages from file extensions
func DetectLanguages(root string) []string {
    // Scan, count extensions, return top languages
}

// Load patterns for detected languages
func LoadPatterns(languages []string) PatternSet {
    // Merge patterns from all detected languages
}
```

### 4.3 Semantic AST Indexing

Instead of regex patterns, use tree-sitter to extract semantic metadata:

```go
type SemanticMetadata struct {
    SymbolType  string   // "function", "class", "method", "interface"
    Name        string   // "Search", "Config", etc.
    Visibility  string   // "public", "private", "internal"
    IsTest      bool     // Determined from AST, not filename
    Language    string   // "go", "python", "typescript"
    Signature   string   // Full function signature
}
```

This would allow queries like:
- "Search function" → Filter by SymbolType="function", Name contains "Search"
- Works identically for Go, Python, JavaScript, Java

### 4.4 Project-Agnostic Validation

Instead of:
```
| Query | Expected | Status |
| Search function | internal/search/engine.go | FAIL |
```

Use:
```
| Query | Expected Criteria | Status |
| {Term} function | SymbolType=function, Name={Term}, IsTest=false, rank < 3 | ? |
```

Run validation against multiple test projects:
- `test-fixtures/go-project/`
- `test-fixtures/python-project/`
- `test-fixtures/typescript-project/`
- `test-fixtures/java-maven-project/`
- `test-fixtures/polyglot-monorepo/`

## Part 5: Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate (Sprint 7)

1. **Document the limitations** in README.md:
   > AmanMCP is currently optimized for Go projects following standard conventions (`internal/`, `cmd/`). Support for other languages is limited.

2. **Make path patterns configurable** in `.amanmcp.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   path_scoring:
     implementation: ["internal/", "src/", "lib/"]
     wrapper: ["cmd/", "scripts/", "bin/"]
   ```

3. **Add more test file patterns** to cover major languages (C#, Java, Rust, Ruby).

### 5.2 Short-term (Sprint 8-9)

1. **Implement language detection** to auto-load appropriate patterns.

2. **Refactor decomposer** to be pattern-driven, not hardcoded:
   ```go
   type LanguagePatterns struct {
       FunctionPatterns []PatternTemplate
       MethodPatterns   []PatternTemplate
       TestPatterns     []string
   }
   ```

3. **Create multi-language test fixtures** and add to CI.

### 5.3 Medium-term (Phase 5)

1. **Semantic indexing via tree-sitter AST**:
   - Extract SymbolType, Name, Visibility, IsTest from AST
   - Index as searchable metadata
   - Enable semantic queries

2. **Polyglot monorepo support**:
   - Detect language per file/directory
   - Apply language-specific patterns per file
   - Unified ranking across languages

### 5.4 Long-term (Research)

1. **Learn patterns from codebase structure**:
   - Identify which paths contain implementations vs wrappers via heuristics
   - Discover test file conventions from file naming patterns
   - Adapt to non-standard project structures

2. **Benchmark on public codebases**:
   - kubernetes/kubernetes (Go)
   - django/django (Python)
   - facebook/react (JavaScript)
   - rust-lang/rust (Rust)
   - Compare search quality across ecosystems

## Part 6: The Uncomfortable Questions

### Q: Are we building a product or a science project?

If the goal is a product that works for our team, the current approach is fine. If the goal is a tool others can use, we need generalization.

### Q: Is 100% Tier 1 on our codebase meaningful?

No. It proves we can tune to our tests. It doesn't prove the tool is good.

### Q: Should we have researched before implementing?

Yes. A literature review of code search tools (Sourcegraph, GitHub Code Search, OpenGrok, Zoekt) would have revealed:
- Language-aware indexing is standard
- AST-based symbol extraction is the norm
- Path heuristics are configurable, not hardcoded

### Q: Is this salvageable?

Yes, but it requires:
1. Acknowledging the problem
2. Deciding if generalization is worth the effort
3. Refactoring incrementally with multi-language tests

---

## Part 7: The Verdict

**We have been solving the wrong problem.**

The problem was not "make `Search function` return `engine.go`."

The problem was "build a code search tool that understands code across languages."

We optimized for the symptom (our failing queries) not the cause (lack of language-aware search).

The "Just Do It Now" philosophy is powerful for shipping, but without periodic reflection, it leads to local maxima—solutions that work here but nowhere else.

## Appendix: What Other Tools Do

| Tool | Language Support | How |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Sourcegraph** | 40+ languages | Language-specific indexers, LSIF |
| **GitHub Code Search** | Many | Syntax-aware tokenization per language |
| **OpenGrok** | 60+ languages | Ctags + language analyzers |
| **Zoekt** | Many | Trigram indexing (language-agnostic) |
| **AmanMCP** | Go (+ partial JS/Python) | Hardcoded patterns |

---

## Conclusion

This is not a failure. This is a learning.

The question now is: do we want AmanMCP to be a Go-specific tool, or a generalizable code search solution?

The answer determines the next phase of work.
